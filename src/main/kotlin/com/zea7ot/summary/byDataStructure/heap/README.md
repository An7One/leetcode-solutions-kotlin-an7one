(Binary) Heap is a special case of balanced binary tree data structure where the root-node key is compared with its
children and arranged accordingly.

Node at index `k` in array has children at indexes `2k + 1` and `2k + 2`.<br/>
Node at index `k` in array has the parent at index `(k - 1)/2` (Truncate fractional part).<br/>
