Given a 2D matrix, and the size of the window `K`,
to find the k * k submatrix with the maximum sum.

e.g.1:
matrix: [[2, 3], [0, 0]]
K: 2

expected to return: 5
the corresponding submatrix: [[2, 3], [0, 0]]

e.g.2:
matrix: [[2, 3, 0], [5, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 3]]
K: 2

expected to return: 10
the corresponding submatrix: [[2, 3], [5, 0]]
