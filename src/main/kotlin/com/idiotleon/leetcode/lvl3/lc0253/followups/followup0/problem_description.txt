    1. to sorted by meeting room IDs
    2. with 1 satisfied, to sort by starting time


e.g.: 
given input:
    intervals: [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]

expected output for reference:
    [0, 0, 30], means that meeting room, ID 0, is occupied from 0 to 30
    [1, 5, 10], means that meeting room, ID 1, is occupied from 5 to 10
    [1, 15, 20], means that meeting room, ID 1, is occupied from 15 to 20

or
    {{[0, 30]}, {[5, 10], [15, 20]}}
